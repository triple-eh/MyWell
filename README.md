# Introducing *MyWell*

## What is *MyWell*?

*MyWell* is a wellness journal with the main purpose to improve our understanding of 
our mental and physical health. Unlike a typical open-ended journal,
*MyWell* offers a structured approach to keep track of the specific sensations and feelings that 
arise in our body and minds. *MyWell*'s offers users to:
1. Enter daily wellness entries associated with specific areas of the body
2. Provide additional context via brief notes
3. Keep track of remedies that make things better
4. Review insights based on historical data

## Who will use *MyWell*?

*MyWell* is geared at anyone who takes an active interest in understanding and improving their health.
*MyWell*'s fundamental belief is that bringing awareness to our everyday feelings and sensations
will ultimately allow us to learn more about ourselves, discover hidden patterns, and maybe even 
find effective remedies. Whether you have chronic pain, injure and re-injure yourself while exercises, or are struggling
with mental health, *MyWell* can help. By completing daily entries you may learn, for example,
that your migraines are more likely to occur on Mondays, or that going for a 15-minute walk helps
you with taming anxiety that prevents you from performing at your best.

## Why I decided to create *MyWell*?
I created *MyWell* because I believe that this tool will be helpful first and foremost to me,
which makes me believe that it will be able to help other people as well. Like so many others,
I am trying to better understand my body and my mind, often asking myself questions like 
"What triggered this pain?", "How long has this sensation lasted? Should I be concerned", and
"What typically helps me to feel better when I''m down?'". 

While there are plenty of wellness apps out there, I haven't found the one that focuses on specific
areas of the body and allows you to monitor sensation in these areas. I believe that capturing
these details will lead to better insights and better wellness outcomes.
